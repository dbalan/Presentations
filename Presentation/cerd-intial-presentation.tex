\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Problem}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Problem}
  \bf{ \large A geographically large campus with many groups of students have to implement an announcement system.}

}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Conventional System}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item {\bf No Flexibility} in selection of audience.\\
    {\it No way of communicating with a part of audience.}\pause
  \item Requires {\bf heavy cabling} around the campus. \pause
  \item Limited {\bf scalability and extensibility}.
    \begin{itemize}

    \item {\it System can't grow beyond a point, power and
        load problems.}
    \item {\it No scope of extending the system
        further. (Things like video, two way paging
        etc.)}
    \end{itemize}
    
  \end{enumerate}
}

\subsection{Solution}

\frame{
  \frametitle{VoIP}
  {\it{\bf Voice Over Internet Protocol} is a family of technologies, methodologies, communication protocols, and transmission techniques for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks, such as the Internet.}\\

\frame[shrink]{
  \frametitle{Advantages}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Each client can be addressed individually. \\
    - User can create gorups to address on-the fly.\pause
  \item Can utilize the existing IP network in campus. \\
    - A major cost in implimenting the system can be made practically nil.\pause
  \item Scalable - Adding a new client is simple as long as there is
    network connectivity \\ 
    - No load problems. \pause
  \item Have an option to build advanced systems.\\
    - Video transmission.\\
    - Two way communication systems.
    \pause
  \item Provision for remote access. \pause
  \item Easy modification of system - No hard circuits. \pause
  \end{enumerate}
}

\frame{   
  \frametitle{Products Currently Available}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item xyz 
  \end{enumerate}
  {\bf No Free Software} products exist, Though almost all core components are available in a compatible license.

}


\frame{
  \frametitle{Protocols}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The {\bf Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)} is an IETF-defined signaling protocol widely used for controlling communication sessions such as voice and video calls over Internet Protocol (IP). The protocol can be used for creating, modifying and terminating two-party (unicast) or multiparty (multicast) sessions. \pause
    
  \item {\bf RTP} provides end-to-end network transport functions suitable for applications transmitting real-time data, such as audio, video or simulation data, over multicast or unicast network services. {\it (RFC 3550)}
  \end{enumerate}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Asterisk}
  \hfill{\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Asterisk_logo.png}}\\
  {\it {\bf Asterisk} is a software implementation of a telephone private branch exchange (PBX); it was created in 1999 by Mark Spencer of Digium. Like any PBX, it allows attached telephones to make calls to one another, and to connect to other telephone services including the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services. Its name comes from the asterisk symbol, “*”.}\\

\frame{
  \large{\bf Asterisk} thus can act as a proxy for routing the {\bf IP multicast transport} we needed to implement.
